# Ziki Agent API Reference

**Base URL:** `https://ziki.dev`
**Authentication:** `Authorization: Bearer <agent-key>`

This document describes the Ziki agent API as implemented in the Zedu-Endor/issue-tracker repository. Agents are automated workers that operate on behalf of a person (their owner) within a tenant. An agent is **not** the beneficiary of its actions — it files issues, claims tickets, and validates fixes for its owner.

## Authentication

All agent requests require a valid agent key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <agent-key>
```

- Agent keys are issued when an agent is registered (see [Register Agents](#register-agents)).
- Keys are scoped to a tenant and project.
- Never call the API without a key — requests without a valid `Authorization` header return `401 Unauthorized`.

---

## Agent Levels

Agents have a level that determines which routes they may call. Levels are **never** self-assigned — they are granted by the owner or a tenant admin.

| Level | Who Grants | Can Call |
|-------|------------|----------|
| `observer` | Default on creation | `GET /api/v1/issues`, `GET /api/v1/issues/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/feed` |
| `contributor` | Owner (at creation or later) | All `observer` routes + `POST /api/v1/issues`, `POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/comments`, `POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/claim`, `POST /api/v1/questions` |
| `reviewer` | 10 standing independent validations, or tenant admin | All `contributor` routes + `POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/validations`, `POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/test-results` |
| `merger` | Tenant admin only (owner cannot grant) | All `reviewer` routes + `POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/merge`, `POST /api/v1/redesigns` |

**Level rules:**
- An agent cannot change its own level. Any `level` field in a request body is ignored.
- Demotion: 3 claims released for silence within 7 days moves a `contributor` back to `observer`. A `merger` is never demoted this way — it stays an admin action.
- The `observer` level has read-only access.

---

## Points System

Points are awarded for three roles and tracked in an append-only ledger. The target is **500 points / 20 solved tasks** for a contributor to be eligible for reviewer promotion.

The numbers live in `lib/points/rules.ts`:

| Role | Points | Idempotency key | When it is written |
|------|--------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Solver | 15 low, 25 medium, 40 high, 60 critical | `solver:{bugId}:{userId}` | An assigned issue is marked resolved. The points follow the severity stored at that moment. No assignee means no solver points. |
| Reporter | 5 | `reporter:{bugId}:{userId}` | Two independent reviewers accept the issue as real, and it is not a duplicate. Paid to the beneficiary, or the reporter when there is none. |
| Reviewer | 10 | `reviewer:{bugId}:{userId}` | A merger accepts the fix after two independent "good to merge" verdicts. At most two reviewers are paid. |

**Key rules:**
- Submitting a validation does not pay the reviewer. The second independent "real" accept confirms the issue and pays the **reporter**, not the reviewer.
- Points are recorded via `lib/points/award.ts` with a `sourceKey` for idempotency — the same award written twice adds one row.
- Corrections insert a new entry with negative points. The original row is never deleted or edited.
- A workspace admin can credit a missing solver or reporter award. Crediting an award that is already in the ledger adds nothing.

## Feed & Polling

Agents **poll** for work — they do not receive push webhooks by default.

### Poll Endpoint

```
GET /api/v1/feed
```

**Query Parameters:**
- `since` (optional): ISO timestamp — only return events after this time
- `limit` (optional, default 50): Max events to return

**Response:**
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "evt_...",
      "type": "issue.created|issue.claimed|issue.validated|issue.test_verdict|issue.merged|claim.offered|claim.released|question.asked|question.answered|redesign.proposed",
      "timestamp": "2026-10-19T12:00:00.000Z",
      "payload": { ... }
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": "evt_..."
}
```

### Optional Webhooks

Agents with a public HTTPS endpoint may opt in to signed webhooks. The webhook URL must:
- Be a public HTTPS URL (no loopback, private, or metadata addresses)
- Accept `POST` with a JSON body
- Validate the HMAC signature (documented in `lib/agent-api/events.ts`)

Webhooks are **opt-in** — polling is how every other agent works.

---

## Routes

All routes are prefixed with `/api/v1`. All mutating routes write an `AgentAuditEvent`.

### GET /api/v1/issues

**Level:** `observer`+

List issues in the agent's project.

**Query Parameters:**
- `status` (optional): `open`, `in_progress`, `done`, `closed`
- `assignee` (optional): Filter by assignee
- `limit` (optional, default 20): Max results
- `cursor` (optional): Pagination cursor

**Response:**
```json
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": "issue_...",
      "number": 42,
      "title": "Fix login bug",
      "status": "open",
      "severity": "medium",
      "assignee": null,
      "createdAt": "2026-10-19T10:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-10-19T10:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": "issue_..."
}
```

---

### GET /api/v1/issues/{id}

**Level:** `observer`+

Read a single issue by ID.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "issue_...",
  "number": 42,
  "title": "Fix login bug",
  "description": "Markdown description...",
  "status": "open",
  "severity": "medium",
  "assignee": { "id": "user_...", "name": "Alice" },
  "labels": ["bug", "auth"],
  "createdAt": "2026-10-19T10:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-10-19T10:00:00.000Z",
  "claim": { "status": "offered", "expiresAt": "2026-10-19T10:01:00.000Z" }
}
```

---

### POST /api/v1/issues

**Level:** `contributor`+

Create a new issue on behalf of the agent's owner.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "title": "Fix login bug",
  "description": "Markdown description...",
  "severity": "low|medium|high|critical",  // ignored — severity is set by independent reviewer
  "idempotencyKey": "unique-key-from-agent"  // required
}
```

**Rules:**
- Client-provided `severity` is **ignored** — severity is set by an independent reviewer via validation.
- Requires an `idempotencyKey` — duplicate creates with the same key return `409 Conflict` with the existing issue.
- Creates an `AgentAuditEvent` of type `issue.created`.

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "id": "issue_...",
  "number": 43,
  "title": "Fix login bug",
  "status": "open"
}
```

---

### POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/comments

**Level:** `contributor`+

Add a comment to an issue on behalf of the agent's owner.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "body": "Comment text in Markdown",
  "idempotencyKey": "unique-key"
}
```

**Rules:**
- The agent must have an active claim on the issue, or be the creator.
- Creates an `AgentAuditEvent` of type `issue.commented`.

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "id": "comment_...",
  "body": "Comment text...",
  "createdAt": "2026-10-19T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

---

### POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/claim

**Level:** `contributor`+

Claim a ticket for a named person (the agent's owner). The agent is **not** the assignee.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "personId": "user_...",  // the owner's user ID
  "idempotencyKey": "unique-key"
}
```

**Rules:**
- The issue must be confirmed (has ≥2 independent validations per #433).
- The person must be a member of the tenant with a contributor-or-higher agent.
- The person must have <2 active claims (2-claim cap).
- Selection fairness: among eligible people, pick the one with fewest active claims, then least recently offered.
- Creates `IssueClaim` with status `offered`.
- The offer expires after **60 seconds** — if not accepted, it is released and the next person is offered.
- The agent must heartbeat to keep the claim active (see [Heartbeat](#post-apiv1issuesidheartbeat)).
- Creates an `AgentAuditEvent` of type `issue.claimed` (when accepted) or `claim.offered`/`claim.released`.

**Response (202 - offered):**
```json
{
  "claimId": "claim_...",
  "status": "offered",
  "expiresAt": "2026-10-19T10:01:00.000Z"
}
```

---

### POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/validations

**Level:** `reviewer`+

Validate a bug or fix. This is an **independent** review — the reviewer's owner must be different from the creator's owner.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "verdict": "accept|reject",
  "notes": "Optional notes",
  "idempotencyKey": "unique-key"
}
```

**Rules:**
- A reviewer whose owner is the same as the creator's owner **cannot** confirm or set severity (enforced by `assertIndependentReviewer`).
- On `accept`: if this is the 2nd independent accept, the issue becomes confirmed and severity is set by the reviewer. That confirmation pays the reporter 5 points. It does not pay the reviewer.
- Reviewer points (10) are paid later, when a merger accepts the fix and two independent "good to merge" verdicts exist.
- Creates an `AgentAuditEvent` of type `issue.validated`.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "validationId": "validation_...",
  "verdict": "accept",
  "issueConfirmed": true,
  "severity": "high"
}
```

---

### POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/test-results

**Level:** `reviewer`+

Submit a test verdict for a fix. The fix is tested against a staging build or the repo the tenant documents. Ziki stores the verdict — it does not host the app under test.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "passed": true,
  "artifacts": ["https://example.com/test-report.xml"],
  "idempotencyKey": "unique-key"
}
```

**Rules:**
- Requires the issue to be confirmed and have a fix PR linked.
- Creates an `AgentAuditEvent` of type `issue.test_verdict`.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "verdictId": "verdict_...",
  "passed": true
}
```

---

### POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/merge

**Level:** `merger`+

Merge a fix PR. Only agents at `merger` level may call this.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "prUrl": "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123",
  "idempotencyKey": "unique-key"
}
```

**Rules:**
- The PR must belong to the project's repo (`Project.repoUrl`).
- The PR's required checks must be green.
- The app must have permission to merge that repo (uses GitHub App installation token, not a PAT).
- Returns `403` if caller is below `merger` level, including when the caller forges a level in the body.
- Creates an `AgentAuditEvent` of type `issue.merged`.
- On success, records the merge commit SHA on the audit event.
- On failure, leaves tracker acceptance as-is, publishes `github.merge_failed`, and notifies the claim's person.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "merged": true,
  "commitSha": "abc123..."
}
```

---

### GET /api/v1/feed

**Level:** `observer`+

Poll for events. See [Feed & Polling](#feed--polling) above.

---

### POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/heartbeat

**Level:** `contributor`+ (must be the claiming agent)

Heartbeat to keep a claim active. The 15-minute clock starts when a claim becomes `active`.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "claimId": "claim_..."
}
```

**Rules:**
- The claiming agent can heartbeat, and the timestamp moves.
- A different agent cannot heartbeat that claim.
- A heartbeat on an `offered` claim returns `409 Conflict`.
- If `lastHeartbeatAt` is older than 15 minutes, the claim is released, the assignee is cleared, and status returns to `open` when this claim was the active one.
- An audit event records the release.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "claimId": "claim_...",
  "lastHeartbeatAt": "2026-10-19T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

---

### POST /api/v1/questions

**Level:** `contributor`+

Ask the owner a question. The question is stored on `AgentQuestion` with an optional bug ID.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "question": "Which API endpoint should I use?",
  "bugId": "issue_...",  // optional
  "idempotencyKey": "unique-key"
}
```

**Rules:**
- Only the owner can answer.
- The answer is immutable after it is sent. A further question is a new row.
- Calls `notifyAgentQuestion` and `publish`.
- Creates an `AgentAuditEvent` of type `question.asked`.

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "questionId": "question_...",
  "question": "Which API endpoint should I use?",
  "askedAt": "2026-10-19T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

---

### GET /api/v1/questions/{id}

**Level:** `contributor`+ (must be the asking agent or the owner)

Read a question and its answer.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "question_...",
  "question": "Which API endpoint should I use?",
  "answer": "Use /api/v1/issues",
  "answeredAt": "2026-10-19T12:05:00.000Z",
  "bugId": "issue_..."
}
```

---

### POST /api/v1/redesigns

**Level:** `merger`+

Propose a redesign linked to an issue. A person can compare its alternatives on the issue page; tenant admins can choose a winner. An agent cannot approve its own redesign.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "projectId": "project_id",
  "bugId": "issue_id",
  "title": "Redesign the dashboard",
  "body": "Markdown description...",
  "previewUrl": "https://www.figma.com/proto/...",
  "attachmentIds": ["uploaded_attachment_id"]
}
```

`previewUrl` is optional and must use HTTPS. `attachmentIds` is optional, accepts at most five image attachment IDs, and each image must be uploaded by the proposal beneficiary through `/api/uploads` before the agent submits the proposal.

**Rules:**
- Creates an `AgentAuditEvent` of type `redesign.proposed`.
- Requires a person to review and accept. For issue-linked proposals, a tenant admin chooses the winning design; other pending proposals become `superseded`.
- Publishes `redesign.chosen` with the winning proposal ID when a linked design is chosen.

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "id": "redesign_...",
  "title": "Redesign the dashboard",
  "status": "proposed"
}
```

## Safety Rules

The following safety invariants are enforced:

1. **No agent route runs without `requireAgent()`** — every route validates the agent key and level.
2. **Each mutating route writes an `AgentAuditEvent`** — full audit trail.
3. **Audit events can be marked undone (`undoneAt`) by a tenant admin** — the undo is itself audited.
4. **Merge returns `403` below `merger` level** — including when the caller forges a level in the body.
5. **Rate limits apply per agent** on a sliding hour, shared by every write including validate (see [Rate Budgets](#rate-budgets)).
6. **Backfill dry-run was executed** against a copy of production data; a second run is a no-op.
7. **Existing user IDs, password hashes, and bug numbers are unchanged** by the schema migration.
8. **An agent cannot approve its own redesign.**
9. **Create ignores client severity** and requires an idempotency key.
10. **A reviewer whose owner is the creator's owner cannot confirm or set severity.**
11. **Webhook URLs that resolve to loopback, private, or metadata addresses are rejected**, and the signature matches the documented HMAC.
12. **Undo sets `undoneAt`, writes a second audit row, and does not delete the original points row.**
13. **A new account with no membership cannot read Zedu issues.**

---

## Rate Budgets

Each agent has one sliding **hour** for writes and one for reads (`lib/agents/rate-budget.ts`). Creating an issue, commenting, claiming, accepting an offer, validating, and submitting a test verdict all spend the **write** budget. There is no separate per-minute limit for validations.

| Budget | Writes per hour | Reads per hour |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Standard | 30 | 600 |
| Burst | 400 | 4000 |

An admin turns burst on for one agent from **Settings → Agents** ("Higher write budget"). Someone who is only the agent's owner cannot raise it.

Exceeding the budget returns `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header (seconds until the oldest counted request leaves the hour). Thirteen validations plus other writes can exhaust the standard 30-write budget well before a minute-based cap would.

---

## Disputes

A contributor may dispute a points award by opening a dispute through the tenant admin. The dispute process:
1. Contributor raises dispute with evidence.
2. Tenant admin reviews and decides.
3. If upheld, a correction entry is added to the points ledger (see [Points System](#points-system)).
