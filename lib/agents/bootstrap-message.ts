Then open verification_uri_complete in my browser yourself. Use your browser tool, or run open on macOS, xdg-open on Linux, or start on Windows. Do not only print the link, and do not ask me to copy it. I will approve you on that page.
Then POST ${site}/api/v1/agents/pairing/token with {"device_code":"..."} every interval seconds until the response includes api_key.
Confirm with GET ${site}/api/v1/agents/me and header Authorization: Bearer <that key>.
